/// \class WindowBase
/// \brief Base class for top-level windows in Anansi.
///
/// The base class extends QMainWindow with an inline notifications feature
/// that enables child widgets to show window-level notifications. All they
/// need to do to be able to do this is to qobject_cast() window() to
/// Anansi::Window * and if it's not `nullptr`, call
/// showTransientInlineNotification() or showInlineNotification().
