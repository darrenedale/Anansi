Todo

- decide on license
- user documentation
- add to equituk.net site
- on OSX, CGI exe selection dialogue opens inside app bundle: fix this.

Deployment

  Linux
	A Makisu project file is included. Use this to build a .deb package to install
	on debian-based distributions. The created package file can probably be
	converted to a .rpm file using alien - this has not been tested.

  OSX
	Use macdeployqt on the app bundle. Do not use this tool to create the .dmg
	file, just use it to embed the Qt frameworks in the bundle. Create a new .dmg
	file and add the app bundle. Also add the icons/ directory so that the Oxygen
	icons are distributed with the application in a re-useable way, and add the
	lgpl-3.0.txt file also.

  Windows
    Nullsoft installer package. Install the icons/ directory and the file
    lgp3-3.0.txt in the installation directory.
